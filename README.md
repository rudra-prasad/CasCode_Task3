# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to showcase the author's understanding of these technologies and their ability to create a responsive and interactive web application.

# Usage
The game is a two-player game, with each player taking turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the board. The player who manages to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The game is designed to be responsive, so it can be played on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
